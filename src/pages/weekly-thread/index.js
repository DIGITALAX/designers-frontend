          The Thread Weekly is a new direct communication stream for anyone to get the latest and
          greatest advances and insights in web3 fashion straight from the pioneering source— the
          Global Designer Network and DIGITALAX.
        </div>
        <div className={styles.description1}>
          It is released weekly and covers topics across all areas of activity, from open source
          contributions, active fashion minting data, to upcoming projects and events that you too
          can tune into.
          <br />
          <br />
          Under this initiative every designer realm and GDN Purveyor too is forking the overarching
          Thread Weekly to begin launching their own version that will focus more specifically on
          their particular subject matter of passion, interest and expertise— whether that be high
          tech sportswear, phygital fashion fabrication, web3 fashion media and branding or
          something located in the far reaches of the metaverse that has not yet been surfaced.
          <br />
          <br />
          In web3, and especially in these early stages of the market, content may not still be king
          as we are all becoming self sovereign, but, it is quite compelling as currency. The Thread
          Weekly and its sub-forks bring greater liquidity and volume around this currency and allow
          for more of the broader market to start sharing in on some of the most valuable insights
          as to how this industry is taking on traditional fashion and burning the virtual store
          houses of the old content robber barons.
          <br />
          <br />
          The tabloid, propagandist and incumbency protection racket web2 media has such a long
          history of blatent information manipulation that entire books could be written about it,
          and, many have.
          <br />
          <br />
          But, until better is built, there is very little will change.
          <br />
          <br />
          And, most web3 media is still shaking off the habits and constraints of web2. We still
          rely on traditional monetisation models. These depend far too much on ad targeting, pay
          walls and behind the scenes simping of established centralising industry leaders or mega
          corporations, where most of what passes for news might as well be written by public
          relations press release plagerists or poorly designed biast and simplistic AI. It’s no
          surprise so much of it increasinly is.
          <br />
          <br />
          To overthrow the behemoths of this age old industry, it isn’t enough to out-trade them, we
          also have to out-type. If better sounds as good to you as it does to us we will see you on
          the keyboard artisan enabled open web3 journal threads.
