          How does anyone make a market?
          <br />
          <br />
          Often it is used to describe activity that occurs between buyers and sellers of financial
          instruments, where the ‘market makers’ are those that provide readily available consistent
          liquidity to either side of a trade and assist in defining the overall market structure.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is incredibly important. Without strong systems in place to support and facilitate ease
          of participation for anyone desiring to interact with a particular market, not only does it
          make it incredibly difficult for that market to grow and expand, but, more destructively,
          ultimately the very definition of a market ceases to exist.

          The GDN is making the market for web3 fashion. We are dynamically seeding the initial
          foundations and building blocks so that anyone that desires to, can start onboarding with a
          clear roadmap and pathway to success, elevation and prosperity.
          <br />
          <br />
          As an essential primary step to this, we are composing the WEB3 FASHION 101— a concentrated
          glossary and reference platform filled with resources, content, assets, materials and
          supplies that can be used by any designer, creator, consumer, fashion or metaverse lover
          either beginning or continuing their journey in the world of web3 fashion, inclusive of
          NFTs, DeFi, digital fashion, hybrid digi-physical, gaming, 3D applications etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          The full scope of the Web3 Fashion 101 is being curated, designed and itemised by the Global
          Designer Network. Each designer in the network has crafted a mix of resources, materials and
          content from different aspects of fashion, 3D modeling, design, NFTs, decentralised
          technologies across the entire pipeline process.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have taken on to buttress the accelerated growth of anyone’s access to and understanding
          of web3 fashion. We are combining perspectives from all the GDN designers to provide a truly
          expansive and modded insight into all available paths, directions and possibilities that one
          can sample and undertake to crossover into the emporium of web3 fashion and beyond.
